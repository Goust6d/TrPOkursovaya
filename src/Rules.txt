The rules of the game "Bulls and Cows"

A certain number is guessed. You must guess it by typing with the keyboard.
When you enter a number you will be shown the number of "Bulls" and "Cows" in the number.
The number of "Bulls" is the number of digits that have coincided numerically and in the order of the place, in the number and number entered.
If the figure does not stand on this place, but it is present in the number conceived, then this figure is considered to be "Cow".
In normal mode, you have 30 attempts.
In a complicated mode, the number of your attempts is limited to 15, so decide carefully. :-)
